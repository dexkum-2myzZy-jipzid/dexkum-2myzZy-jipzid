Hello! 👋🏻 My name is **Liang (Mario) Chen**. I am from Northeastern University, where I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Software Engineering. 🎓

I started my software development career in Mobile development 📱, working for 5 years as an iOS Developer and 1 year as a Flutter Developer in the Fintech industry. 💰 During this time, I've crafted several applications, including [Hashkey Me](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hashkey-me-simple-secure/id1547228803) and [HongTa Securities - Zhiyue Wealth](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/id529436337).

Last year, I decided to take a significant leap forward by pursuing a Master's degree 🎓, following my passion for Computer Science. 💻

During my first semester at Northeastern University (NEU), I learned Web Development 🕸️ and Java ☕. Here are my Web Development project, [Film 🎬](https://github.com/dexkum-2myzZy-jipzid/film.git), and Java Spring Boot project, [Inventory Management System 📦](https://github.com/dexkum-2myzZy-jipzid/inventory-management-system), which are pinned on my GitHub.

Currently, I am expanding my horizons by delving into front-end development, [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/dexkum-2myzZy-jipzid/leetcode.git). 🧑‍💻

I am open to connecting and discussing the exciting intersections of technology and innovation. 🤝 You can reach out to me at liang.chen829@gmail.com. Let's explore this ever-evolving world together. 🚀

**[** Mobile Development 📱, Web Development 🕸️, Backend Development ⚙️ **]**
